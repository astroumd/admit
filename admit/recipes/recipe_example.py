  **Recipe Example** --- An example recipe that you can use to create your own.
  ============================================================================

  This script is similar to the recipe Archive_Pipeline that
  produces locally standard JAO ADMIT pipeline products.
  The flow is:

   #. Ingest the cube and continuum image into ADMIT doing primary beam correction  if PB file(s) supplied. This will create CASA images if inputs are FITS.
   #. Calculate statistics on cube for later use
   #. Make a zeroth moment map over all emission in the cube.
   #. Make a position-velocity (PV) slice oriented on the moment emission from the previous step.
   #. Find segments with emission or absorption and try to ID the line(s)
   #. Cut out cubes for each line found; cube name is line name
   #. Calculate moment 0,1,2 maps for each line cube
   #. Make a spectrum at the peak in each moment map
   #. Make a PV slice through the peak in each moment map
   #. Search for sources in the continuum map down to a given cutoff.
   #. Make a spectrum at each source found from in the previous step.

   Required non-keyword arguments are set in the REQARGS list and option
   non-keyword arguments are set in the OPTARGS list.  You can create
   keywords for the script to use by modifying the  KEYS and KEYSDESC
   dictionaries.
