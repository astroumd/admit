    Change a series of BDPs into another BDP.

    **Keywords**

      **file**: string
          Output filename created, from which the BDP is named as well
          as "<file>.bdp".  The BDP is always created. The file itself
          will depend on the touch= keyword.
          If the filename is blank, it will generate an output filename
          by appending _11 to the input filename.

      **touch**: bool
          Create a 0-length file that the output BDP will point to [False].

      **exist**: bool
          Files belonging to the input BDPs must exist to pass [True].

    **Input BDPs**

      **File_BDP**: count: `varies`
          Test inputs.

    **Output BDPs**

      **File_BDP**: count: 1
