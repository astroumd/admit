CASA requirements:
    Without CASA you can currently do very little with ADMIT (although a version of
    ADMIT does exist that works with some of the Radio Astro Tools).
    
    Here is where you should get CASA:
    
    http://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml
    http://casa.nrao.edu/installlinux.shtml
    https://casa.nrao.edu/installMacOS.shtml

    e.g. the latest ones are:

    https://casa.nrao.edu/download/distro/linux/release/el7/casa-release-5.1.1-5.el7.tar.gz    
    https://casa.nrao.edu/download/distro/linux/release/el6/casa-release-5.1.1-5.el6.tar.gz    

    https://casa.nrao.edu/download/distro/osx/release/10.12/casa-release-5.1.1-5-10.12.dmg
    https://casa.nrao.edu/download/distro/osx/release/10.11/casa-release-5.1.1-5-10.11.dmg

    
    and there are also pre-releases in: (pick your os from el7, el6, 10.13, 10.12, 10.11)
    
    https://casa.nrao.edu/download/distro/linux/prerelease/


Programs you will need if you develop: (apart from the obvious things like python etc.)

		         package names
    program       ubuntu                redhat
    -----------   -------------------   --------------------
    autoconf      autoconf              autoconf
    csh           tcsh                  tcsh
    pdflatex      texlive-latex-base
    dot           graphviz
		  libgraphviz-dev
    dia           dia
    fig2dev       transfig
    sphinx-build  python-sphinx         python-sphinx
                  python-numpydoc       python-numpydoc
    convert       imagemagick           ImageMagick

If you want to use the non-CASA tests, you will also need

    python        python                python
    ipython       ipython               ipython
    pip           python-pip
    matplotlib    python-matplotlib     python-matplotlib
    numpy         python-numpy          numpy
    scipy         python-scipy          scipy

Other recommended packages are:

    pylint        pylint                pylint


Reminder on package installation methods in a few Linux and Mac distro's:

ubuntu:    apt-get install <package>
redhat:    yum install <package>
fedora22:  dnf install <package>
openSUSE:  zypper install <package>

macports:  port install <package>        (see also /opt/local/...)
homebrew:  brew install <package>        (see also /usr/local/Cellar)


Some known peculiar situations
------------------------------

fedora22: it needs libpng12

ubuntu:   it needs a new symlink to the system version of CASA's libtinfo.so.5, viz.

	  cd $CASA_ROOT/lib ; ln -sf /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5

Example installation script
---------------------------

  # Example script to automate install if you have automated installs:
  $ADMIT/scripts/get_stable_casa_admit             install both casa and admit, only for linux


  # Example scripts to re-run a whole buildbot style (you'll need to taylor it for your local setup)
  $ADMIT/scripts/redo_from_scratch*


# example session:

git clone https://github.com/astroumd/admit
cd admit
autoconf
./configure --with-casa-root=/opt/casa-release-5.1.1-5.el7
source admit_start.sh

# 0: test the admit environment settings
admit

# 1: unit tests (will need CASA in your environment)
make unit

# 2: integratation tests (will need CASA)
make integration

# 3: regression (will need CASA)
make regression

# 4: testdata (will grab some data via FTP)
make testdata
cd testdata
runa1 test0.fits

# a new DTD should not leave modified or new files
# we need CASA for this
cd $ADMIT
make dtd
git status




How a developer needs to set up sphinx in their version of casa's python:
=========================================================================
cd $ADMIT/integration-test
make pip                         (fails on FC22, try the old 'make pip1')
rehash                           (if you're in a csh type shell)
which pip                        (should now see the casa version)
pip install --upgrade pip
rehash
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install sphinx               (can have zlib error, install docutils manually)
pip install numpydoc
rehash
which sphinx-build               (should see the casa version now)
cd ..    
make html
make pdf

The installation of sphinx is known to fail on some systems (e.g. redhat/SL),
which was due to a failing docutils install in a compression library.
The solution here was to manually install docutils,
from http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

Example
    tar zxf docutils-0.12.tar.gz
    cd docutils-0.12
    python setup.py install
or try the latest
    svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/docutils/code/trunk docutils-code
    cd docutils-code/docutils
    python setup.py install
    
after which the pip install should work again.

Some rumors exist that the system version of sphinx-build may work on your
system, but it's very easy to get shared libraries of cblas (which numpy
uses) to trigger error messages if you use a sphinx not built with casa's
python.   YMMV.


Some notes on CASA installations
================================

CASA6
-----

As of March 2020 ADMIT was converted to use python3 instead of python2. This in
order to be able to take advantage of CASA6, which uses python3. This work is
ongoing and taking place in a branch called "python3". Contact Peter if you want
to know more.

See https://github.com/astroumd/admit/projects/1 for progress
