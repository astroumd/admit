#  meant to run from inside an admit directory
#  useful to test re-running
#
#  A slightly easier way to re-run, although one can also teach
#  each admit1.py style script to do the re-run.
#  If you use admit0, this is the procedure:
#
#  admit1.py foobar.fits        # this will also write an admit.apar
#  cd foobar.admit
#  $EDITOR admit.apar           # edit the parameter file
#  admit0.py                    # rerun it
#
#     
#  Warning: if an AT fails, it's quite possible the state of 
#           ADMIT is not consistent, and the next re-run would
#           result in irreproducable errors.  
#           If so, go back to step 1.
#           Also, and this is a more serious problem, if the flow
#           produces a variable number of BDPs, the static flow
#           doesn't know how to handle this, and the flow will crash.
#           If so, go back to step 1 as well.
