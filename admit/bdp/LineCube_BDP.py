    """ Class for holding LineCube data.

        This class holds both a spectral cube and line information of a
        specific spectral line.

        Parameters
        ----------
        xmlFile : str
            Output XML file name.

        keyval : dict
            Dictionary of keyword:value pairs.

        Attributes
        ----------
        image : Image
            Instance of the Image class to hold the spectral cube.

        line : Line
            Instance of the Line class to hold an information on the spectral
            line.

        linewidth : float
            The width of the spectral line, in km/s.

        linechans : string
            The start and end channels in the linecube that actually comprise
            the line. Example "10~20", which would be channels 10 through
 	    (and including) 20. These are channel numbers based on this cube,
            not the original spectral window cube or where ever it was derived
            from.
