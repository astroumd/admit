How to read the pipeline results:

- when lines don't match up?
- VLSR is on top
- a V scale in red is below, centered at 0, positive to the left (since freq always increases to the right)

- sometimes you will see 2 CSP's (through CSM and cube max)
  CSP_0 is from the peak in the CSM, for low S/N this may not show a peak
  CSP_1 is from the peak in the cube, and this might then show a peak
  sometimes 3. what's the 3rd ?

- We need some heuristics to detect such features, and have a suite of links
  that links towards can be used in our live index.html/accordion
