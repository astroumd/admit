For developers:  (only CASA 4.6 and above are supported)

To grab the git based source code

  git clone https://github.com/astroumd/admit.git

There are some automated scripts in  $ADMIT/scripts/ that you can tailor for installation

  setenv CASA_ROOT /your/casa      (or :  export CASA_ROOT=/your/casa)
  make config                      (it needs $CASA_ROOT if you want to include that CASA via ADMIT)
  source admit_start.csh           (or the .sh variant if your shell is not a csh variant)


A few simple tests:

  make python0              (should work without casa)
  make python1   	    (needs CASA in the environment) - can hang on a mac?  try 'make python2'

This last test is important, it will verify if you have properly
integrated CASA in your shell. This is something that has changed
over the lifetime of CASA. ($PATH, $LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc.)


CASA requirements:
    Without CASA you can currently do very little with ADMIT.

Programs you will need: (apart from the obvious things like python etc.)

		         package names
    program       ubuntu                redhat
    -----------   -------------------   --------------------
    autoconf      autoconf              autoconf
    csh           tcsh                  tcsh
    pdflatex      texlive-latex-base
    dot           graphviz
		  libgraphviz-dev
    dia           dia
    fig2dev       transfig
    sphinx-build  python-sphinx         python-sphinx
                  python-numpydoc       python-numpydoc
    convert       imagemagick           ImageMagick

If you want to use the non-CASA tests, you will also need

    python        python                python
    ipython       ipython               ipython
    pip           python-pip
    matplotlib    python-matplotlib     python-matplotlib
    numpy         python-numpy          numpy
    scipy         python-scipy          scipy

Other recommended packages are:

    pylint        pylint                pylint


Reminder on package installation methods in a few Linux and Mac distro's:

ubuntu:    apt-get install <package>
redhat:    yum install <package>
fedora22:  dnf install <package>
openSUSE:  zypper install <package>

macports:  port install <package>        (see also /opt/local/...)
homebrew:  brew install <package>        (see also /usr/local/Cellar)


Some known peculiar situations
------------------------------

fedora22: it needs libpng12

Sample installation
-------------------

  Sample scripts:
  $ADMIT/scripts/get_stable-casa_admit             install both casa and admit, only for linux

# 

git clone ....
cd admit
autoconfig
./configure --with-casa-root=/astromake/opt/casa/stable
source admit_start.csh

# unit tests (these are pure python tests, and not essential for ALMA)
make unit0

# unit tests (will need CASA in your environment)
make unit

# integratation tests (will need CASA)
make integration

# a DATA test (will need CASA)
make foobar
cd data
../admit/test/admit1.py foobar.fits x

# a new DTD should not leave modified or new files
# we need CASA for this
cd $ADMIT
make dtd
git status





How a developer needs to set up sphinx in their version of casa's python:
=========================================================================
cd $ADMIT/integration-test
make pip                         (fails on FC22, try the old 'make pip1')
rehash                           (if you're in a csh type shell)
which pip                        (should now see the casa version)
pip install --upgrade pip
rehash
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install sphinx               (can have zlib error, install docutils manually)
pip install numpydoc
rehash
which sphinx-build               (should see the casa version now)
cd ..    
make html
make pdf

The installation of sphinx is known to fail on some systems (e.g. redhat/SL),
which was due to a failing docutils install in a compression library.
The solution here was to manually install docutils,
from http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

Example
    tar zxf docutils-0.12.tar.gz
    cd docutils-0.12
    python setup.py install
or try the latest
    svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/docutils/code/trunk docutils-code
    cd docutils-code/docutils
    python setup.py install
    
after which the pip install should work again.

Some rumors exist that the system version of sphinx-build may work on your
system, but it's very easy to get shared libraries of cblas (which numpy
uses) to trigger error messages if you use a sphinx not built with casa's
python.   YMMV.
