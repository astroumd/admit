    """ Detect peaks in data based on their amplitude and other features.

        Parameters
        ----------
        spec : 1D array_like
            The input spectra to search for peaks.

        x : 1D array_like
            The x co-ordinates for the spectrum (optional).
            Default: None.

        kwarg : Dict
            Any additional arguments, see the Attributes list for a complete
            listing.

        Attributes
        ----------
        spec : 1D array_like
            The input spectra to search for peaks.

        x : 1D array_like
            The x co-ordinates for the spectrum (optional)
            Default: None.

        thresh : float
            Detect peaks that are greater than minimum peak height.
            Default: 0.0.

        min_sep : int
            Detect peaks that are at least separated by minimum peak distance, in
            number of channels.
            Default : 5.

        edge : str
            One of 'rising', 'falling', or 'both', optional.
            For a flat peak, keep only the rising edge ('rising'), only the
            falling edge ('falling'), both edges ('both').
            Default : 'rising'.

        kpsh : bool
            Keep peaks with same height even if they are closer than `min_sep`,
            optional.
            Default: False.

            Notes
            -----
            The detection of valleys instead of peaks is performed internally by simply
            negating the data: `ind_valleys = detect_peaks(-x)`
    
            The function can handle NaN's
