#  Flow11_AT is the most simple one-BDP-in one-BDP-out AT.
#  See also HelloWorld_AT() for a nicely annotated one
#  in our standard admit+python style
#  
#  This AT is also supposed to work without CASA, hence
#  the first line being     '#! /usr/bin/env python' 
#
#  It also contains some routines for testing, and commented out
#  code to compare system call vs. native call. Leave those in 
#  please, but the default code is optimized for speed (native
#  calls)

class Flow11_AT(AT):
    """Flow11_AT will change one File_BDP into another File_BDP,
    purely to test or emulate a flow. It will also implement an
    example how parameters are added back from the AT to ADMIT
    using the summary feature.

    See also :ref:`Flow-AT-Design` for the design document that
    describes the Flow family.

    Together with Flow1N_AT and FlowN1_AT these are AT's that take
    File_BDP's as input (1 or N), and produce File_BDP's 
    as output (1 or N). 

    Input files pointed to in the BDP's do not have to exist, but the
    AT can be forced to check for those (**exist=True**).

    Output files listed in the BDP's can be ignored, but can also
    be created as 0-length files (**touch=True**).

    The use of "**exist**" and "**touch**" thus symmetrizes the way how
    the Flow*_AT's can be used to emulate the dependancy of a flow
    on file existence and/or creation.

    Flow11_AT adds the following to ADMIT summary::

       datamin: real
          The datamin parameter of foobar.

       datamax: real
          The datamin parameter of foobar.

       rmsmethd: dictionary
          A list describing the rms method.


    **Keywords**

      **file**: string
          Output filename created, from which the BDP is named as well
          as "<file>.bdp".  The BDP is always created. The file itself
          will depend on the touch= keyword.
          If the filename is blank, it will generate an output filename
          by appending _11 to the input filename.

      **touch**: bool
          Create a 0-length file that the output BDP will point to [True].

      **exist**: bool
          Input file that belongs to a BDP must exist to pass [True].

    **Input BDPs**

      **File_BDP**: count: 1
          Test input.

    **Output BDPs**

      **File_BDP**: count: 1
          Test output.
