ADMIT pre-installed
-------------------

If ADMIT has been installed on your system already, the only thing you
need to do is source the appropriate **admit_start** script in your Unix shell.
Use the **.sh**
or **.csh** version depending on what flavor shell you are
using. On most Linux and Mac systems these days give you **bash** as
the default shell, so this would be

.. code-block:: bash

    source /path/to/admit_start.sh

but the csh/tcsh version is also fully functional.
Then test if the basics work with the command

.. code-block:: bash

     admit

You should now also be able to **import admit** from within your CASA session
and/or run an appropriate ADMIT script.
Note that typing "admit" does not put you into an "admit" shell; it just prints
out path definitions to show you that ADMIT is set-up for use.


ADMIT install from scratch
--------------------------

If you do not have ADMIT installed, or want a fresh install, grab the
latest export version of the source code and install it. This will typically
not even take a minute, as no compilation is needed! It just assumes you have
CASA pre-installed, and know of its location on the system.
Or head over to http://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml to install this
for your system. ADMIT should work with CASA V4.5 and up.



Grab a version of the source code, 
pick one of many ways to do this:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget http://admit.astro.umd.edu/admit.tar.gz
    
    curl http://admit.astro.umd.edu/admit.tar.gz  | tar -zxf -
    
    
and untar this file, then execute the configure step to create the
two admit_start scripts. You will need to know where on your system
the casa root directory is located. Here is a sample session for
both Linux and Darwin:

.. code-block:: bash

    tar zxf admit.tar.gz
    ls
    cd admit_1.X.x
    ./configure --with-casa-root=/path/to/casa-release-4.7.2-el6

    ./configure --with-casa-root=/Applications/CASA.app/Contents

where a CASA release had been placed in the /path/to/casa-release-4.7.2-el6
(a typical Linux example) or /Applications/CASA.app/Contents (the common Darwin
example)
and admit_1.X.x is the downloaded version of ADMIT. You can also *wget* that
fully named version, but the latest is always available under the generic name.
If you have a version of ADMIT without the configure script , you might be able
to use the scripts/configure script instead (formally configure should be
created with the autoconf command).

Now you can source the startup file and you are set:

.. code-block:: bash

    source admit_start.sh

If you want to check that ADMIT is set-up you can type:

.. code-block:: bash

    admit

and will now see the directory paths and versions. Congratulations!

Even though this discussion is out of scope here, the ADMIT development version
can be obtained from http://github.com/astroumd/admit

Documentation
-------------

Your export version should come with an html as well as PDF version of the manual.
Point your favorite tool at one of the following

.. code-block:: bash

    $ADMIT/docs/latex/ADMIT.pdf

    $ADMIT/docs/html/index.html
