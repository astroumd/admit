class BDPReader(object):
    """ Class to read in a bdp file (xml style) and convert it to a BDP object in memory. Only the
        name of the bdp file (including any relative or absolute path) needs to be specified. The
        given file will be passed to the AdmitParser where it will be parsed. The resulting data
        will be inserted into a BDP object of the appropriate type (type is determined by the
        contents of the bdp file). The BDP object is the returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file : str
            File name (including any relative or absolute path) of the bdp file to be parsed and 
            converted to a BDP object.  If not specified here, it needs to be specified at read().
            Default : None.

        Attributes
        ----------
            File name (including any relative or absolute path) of the bdp file to be parsed and 
            converted to a BDP object.
