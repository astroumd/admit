For developers:  (only CASA 4.6 and above are supported)

To grab the git based source code

  git clone https://github.com/astroumd/admit.git


CASA requirements:
    Without CASA you can currently do very little with ADMIT. 
    http://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml

    http://casa.nrao.edu/install xxx.shtml

    e.g. the latest ones are
    
    https://svn.cv.nrao.edu/casa/distro/linux/release/el6/casa-release-4.6.0-el6.tar.gz
    https://svn.cv.nrao.edu/casa/distro/linux/release/el6/casa-release-4.5.3-el6.tar.gz

    https://svn.cv.nrao.edu/casa/distro/osx/release/10.9/casa-release-4.5.3-10.9.dmg

Programs you will need: (apart from the obvious things like python etc.)

		         package names
    program       ubuntu                redhat
    -----------   -------------------   --------------------
    autoconf      autoconf              autoconf
    csh           tcsh                  tcsh
    pdflatex      texlive-latex-base
    dot           graphviz
		  libgraphviz-dev
    dia           dia
    fig2dev       transfig
    sphinx-build  python-sphinx         python-sphinx
                  python-numpydoc       python-numpydoc
    convert       imagemagick           ImageMagick

If you want to use the non-CASA tests, you will also need

    python        python                python
    ipython       ipython               ipython
    pip           python-pip
    matplotlib    python-matplotlib     python-matplotlib
    numpy         python-numpy          numpy
    scipy         python-scipy          scipy

Other recommended packages are:

    pylint        pylint                pylint


Reminder on package installation methods in a few Linux and Mac distro's:

ubuntu:    apt-get install <package>
redhat:    yum install <package>
fedora22:  dnf install <package>
openSUSE:  zypper install <package>

macports:  port install <package>        (see also /opt/local/...)
homebrew:  brew install <package>        (see also /usr/local/Cellar)


Some known peculiar situations
------------------------------

fedora22: it needs libpng12

ubuntu:   it needs a new symlink to the system version of CASA's libtinfo.so.5, viz.

	  cd $CASA_ROOT/lib ; ln -sf /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5

Sample installation
-------------------

  Sample scripts:
  $ADMIT/scripts/get_stable-casa_admit             install both casa and admit, only for linux

# 

git clone https://github.com/astroumd/admit
cd admit
autoconfig
./configure --with-casa-root=/opt/casa-release-4.7.0-el6
source admit_start.sh

# unit tests (will need CASA in your environment)
make unit

# integratation tests (will need CASA)
make integration

# regression (will need CASA)
make regression

# make testdata
cd testdata
runa1 test0.fits

# a new DTD should not leave modified or new files
# we need CASA for this
cd $ADMIT
make dtd
git status




How a developer needs to set up sphinx in their version of casa's python:
=========================================================================
cd $ADMIT/integration-test
make pip                         (fails on FC22, try the old 'make pip1')
rehash                           (if you're in a csh type shell)
which pip                        (should now see the casa version)
pip install --upgrade pip
rehash
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install sphinx               (can have zlib error, install docutils manually)
pip install numpydoc
rehash
which sphinx-build               (should see the casa version now)
cd ..    
make html
make pdf

The installation of sphinx is known to fail on some systems (e.g. redhat/SL),
which was due to a failing docutils install in a compression library.
The solution here was to manually install docutils,
from http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

Example
    tar zxf docutils-0.12.tar.gz
    cd docutils-0.12
    python setup.py install
or try the latest
    svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/docutils/code/trunk docutils-code
    cd docutils-code/docutils
    python setup.py install
    
after which the pip install should work again.

Some rumors exist that the system version of sphinx-build may work on your
system, but it's very easy to get shared libraries of cblas (which numpy
uses) to trigger error messages if you use a sphinx not built with casa's
python.   YMMV.
