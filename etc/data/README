Small (!) sample data for testing or examples can be placed here.

Big test data are normally in $ADMIT/testdata, which is normally also 
a link to a place on your system where you have obtained these general
testdata from. 
We do keep commented apar files here, to guide you through experiments
with these fits files.

*.apar                admitX.py parameter files (commented examples)
*.rout                REGRESSION output to be tested against


cube432.fits          a 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 fits cube; testing row/column major (data=i+10j+100k)
cube432.admit.tar.gz  ADMIT project (only an ingest) for a very basic test
test0551.tab          a testCubeSpectrum.tab file from EDGE, for testing
test0551.tab.apar     the corresponding apar file for admit4.py
fluxes.tab            final fluxed from the M3-bb regression
